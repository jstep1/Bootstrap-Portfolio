                        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Jeremy Stepanovich - I was born on October 3rd, 1991 in my hometown of Des Plaines, Illinois. I attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and received a Bachelor's Degree in Statistics. Upon graduation I pursued a sales career in the cybersecurity industry where I was initially introduced to the wonders of today's technologies.</p>
                        <p>My interactions with colleagues and general interest in learning more about the industry lead me to my current endeavor into the world of programming. I enrolled in the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp in hopes of expanding my skillset and receiving a position as a full-stack web developer.</p>
                        <p>Another reason I wanted to learn to code was to work in the field of blockchain technologies (which is moreso a hobby/interest of mine). After learning about how this technology can shape the world in the same way the internet did in the 1990's it was evident that this would soon become part of our everyday lives in some capacity.</p>
                        <p>Take a look through my portfolio page! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did creating it.</p></div>
